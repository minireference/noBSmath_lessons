    "## Programming 101\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming consists of writing down instructions for a computer. The instuctions are also called \"commands\", \"code\", \"source code\", etc. Since this tutorial is about Python, all the instructions in the boxes you'll see below are written in the Python programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can \"run\" the code in a given box by pressing the play button on the left side, or by pressing _Shift_ and _Enter_ keys at the same time. When you run a code cell, you're telling the computer to \"execute\" the Python instructions in that cell, which means to do the actions described in the code, and print the final value computed in that cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a code cell is similar to using the EQUALS button on the calculator: whatever math expression you entered, the calculator will compute its value and display it as the output. The process is identical when you execute some Python code, but you're allowed to input multiple lines of commands at once. The computer will execute the lines of code one by one in the order it sees them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of final calculations in the cell gets automatically printed in the output cell right below the input cell. This feature allows you to skip the print statments, since the last output gets printed automatically for you. This makes it easy and fun to explore and \"poke around\" each example given in this notebook. Click the `[+ Code]` button below any cell to add a blank cell where you can try inputting some expressions and running them by pressing _Shift_ and _Enter_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Errors\n",
    "Sometimes the executed commands will cause an error, and in these cases Python will give an error message describing the problem encountered. Get psychologically ready for those, because they can be very discouraging. REJECTED! The computer doesn't like what you entered. SyntaxError, ValueError, etc. The error messages look scary, but really they are there to help you—if you read what the error message tells you, you will know what needs to be fixed in your input. The error message literally describes the problem!"

    "\n",
    "Similar to the notion of number sets in math $\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{R}$ etc., computers variables also come in different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **int** - integers ex: `34`,`65`, `78`, `-4`, etc. (rougly equivalent to $\\mathbb{Z}$)\n",
    "- **float** - ex: `4.6`,`78.5`, `1e-3` (full name is \"floating point number\"; similar to $\\mathbb{R}$ but only with finite precision)\n",
    "- **bool** a Boolean truth value with only two choices: `True` or `False`.\n",
    "- **string** - text ex: `'Hello'`, `'Hello everyone'`\n",
    "- **list** a sequence of values ​​- ex: `[69, 81, 92, 77]`. The beginning and the end of the list are denoted by the brackets `[` and `]`, and its elements are separated by commas.\n",
    "- **dictionary** a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a value - ex: `{'first_name': 'Julie', 'last_name': 'Tremblay', 'score': 98}`. Dictionaries are denoted by curly braces `{` and `}` inside which we place `'key': value`, pairs separated by commas.\n",
    "- **tuples**, **sets**, **functions**, etc. = there are seveal other interesting and useful Python building blocks, which we'll talk about in the next episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign a value to a variable, you use the symbol `=` as follows, from left to right:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we start by writing the name of the variable\n",
    "* then, we add the symbol `=`\n",
    "* finally, we write the value of the variable\n",

    "I know this seems like boring details, but please read the next example carefully because \"truthyness\" and \"falsyness\" will play a big role in coding: every time you use an if or elif statement in Python, we are implicitly calling `bool` on an expression so it's a good idea to get to know what `bool` does to different types of variables."

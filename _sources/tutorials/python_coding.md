# Python Coding Tutorial

Learn the basics of Python. Just enough to be dangerous with numbers and for loops.
Nothing fancy. We'll be mostly using Python as a basic calculator for math expressions,
and "boring" calculations that require repeating the same action many times (for loops).

So if you know how to use a calculator, then you know how to use Python too.

If you remember some basic math concepts like variables, expressions, and functions,
then you already know most of all there is to know!
